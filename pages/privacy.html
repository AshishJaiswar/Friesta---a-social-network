        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p><b><i>Friesta</i></b> ("Friesta," "we," "us," or "our") takes the private nature of your information very
            seriously.
            This policy regarding our privacy practices (the "Privacy Policy") describes how we treat the information
            we collect when you visit and use Friesta.com (the "Site"). Friesta is a subsidiary of Automattic, a
            technology company that empowers people to
            build beautiful websites, tell their stories, and find and grow their audience. The way we handle your
            information hasn’t changed, so this Privacy Policy still governs when you are on Friesta, using a Friesta
            website. We may share non-personal information
            with our family companies for purposes such as product improvements, research and analysis, and to help
            them provide you with more relevant experiences. When you use the Services, you also consent to the
            collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your
            information as described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully.
        </p>
        <h2>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or
            accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any information
            about you that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners.
        </p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own,
            control, or manage, including but not limited to any third party websites, services,
            applications, or businesses (“Third Party Services”). While we try to work only with
            those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we don't take responsibility
            for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to
            carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.
        </p>
        <p>Also: This Privacy Policy doesn’t govern what our users do on their Friesta blogs and we
            aren't responsible for the information collection and use practices of our individual
            blogs and bloggers. One of the great features of Friesta's products is customizability, and
            bloggers have a lot of flexibility in how their blogs behave. When you visit a blog in our network,
            that blog may collect more information than we do, and may provide information to third parties that
            we have no relationship with, including to advertisers.
        </p>
        <h2>What We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
        <p><b>Account Information:</b> When you create an account on the Services (an "Account"),
            we’ll ask you for information such as your username, password, age, and email address
            (“Account Information”). We may use Account Information, alone or together with other
            information, to enhance and improve the Services, such as by personalization. We use your
            age to verify that you can lawfully use the Services. We use your email address to verify
            your Account and to communicate with you, as described in more detail below. We also allow
            users to look for their friends by email address; you can, however, opt out of email lookup
            through your Account Settings.
        </p>
        <p><b>Email Communications with Us:</b> As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive
            email and other communications from us. Administrative communications relating to your
            Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset) are considered part of
            the Services and your Account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. We also
            may send you other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of either from your Account Settings
            page or by using the “Opt-Out” link in the emails themselves. Note that we will never email
            you to ask for your password or other Account Information; if you receive such an email,
            please forward it to us.
        </p>
        <p><b>User Content:</b> By default, all sharing through the Services is public, and when you
            provide us with content it is published so that anyone can view it. Also, please keep in mind that anything
            you share privately with another user, particularly
            through an Ask, Fan Mail, or submitted post, may be posted publicly by that user. Content published
            and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose any
            privacy rights you might have regarding that content. In addition, information shared publicly
            may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through actions or features native
            to the Services.
        </p>
        <p><b>Native Actions:</b> The Services allow you to perform native actions that are integral to our
            products, such as liking a post, blogging a post, replying to a post, and following a
            blog. Liking, reblogging, and replying are public actions – anyone can expand the “notes”
            view on a post, for example, to see who liked, reblogged, or replied to a post. We use
            information about native actions to improve the Services, develop new Services, and,
            particularly, to personalize your Tumblr experience. Personalization using this information
            may include presenting you with new posts relevant to what you’ve liked, providing you with
            better search results, and showing you advertising more relevant to your interests.
